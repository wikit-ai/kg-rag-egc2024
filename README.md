The conference will take place in Dijon, France from January 22nd to 26th, 2024.

## Demonstration overview

<!-- TODO -->

## Demonstration setup

<!-- TODO -->

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate

cd src
pip install -r requirements.txt

uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Graph Construction

To use the demonstrator, you should have a graph instance running. 

In this work, only specific parts of the SustainGraph are built.
The entire project is available here [https://gitlab.com/netmode/sustaingraph](https://gitlab.com/netmode/sustaingraph).

A running Neo4j instance is needed.

Environment variables must be set : 

```sh
export GRAPH_URI=<GRAPH_URI>
export GRAPH_USER=<GRAPH_USER>
export GRAPH_PASSWORD=<GRAPH_PASSWORD>
```

Then, the graph construction script can be run to construct specific parts of the SustainGraph : 

```sh
python3 graph_construction/graph_construction.py
```
